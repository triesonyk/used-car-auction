# Used Car Dataset Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing and Machine Learning Modelling

## Intro 
Hi, this is my first Machine Learning projects. The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/used-car-auction-prices). This is also my bootcamp's final project. This is a team project and I acted as the team leader.

## Workstages

- Problem Statement: State the problem that we want to solve. In this project we want to create a business recommendation that can increase the revenue of the business model
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Insights: Finding insights that can be used as a business recommendation also using the EDA as a basis for data preprocessing.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform, extract and doing other manipulation to make the data usable in Machine Learning Modelling
- Machine Learning Modelling: Creating the best fitted ML Model. We tried a couple algorithm that suited the dataset, the best model was created using XGBoost Regressor. We also did Hyperparameter Tuning to find the best parameter.
